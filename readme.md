# RUN RANdom PLAYlist

ie, play random songs. simply. 

* Utilising `find` for the heavy lifting of finding files, and `mpv` to play them. 
* Keeps a history of recently played files to avoid repetition
* Can choose randomly between albums, but play albums in order
  - Albums defined as a directory of music
  - "play in order" relies on sensible naming of files
